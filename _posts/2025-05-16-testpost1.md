# ðŸ“Š Tracking the F3 Visa Bulletin Trends (2020â€“2025)

Understanding the movement of the U.S. Department of Stateâ€™s **Visa Bulletin** is critical for families awaiting immigrant visa availability. In this post, we take a focused look at the **F3 category**â€”which applies to **married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens**â€”and examine how the **Final Action Dates** and **Dates for Filing** have changed over the past **five years**.

To analyze long-term trends, we extracted data from official bulletins published each **February, May, August, and November**, representing the second month of each quarter from **2020 through 2025**.

## ðŸ§­ Understanding the Key Terms

- **Final Action Date**: The cutoff date for when a green card can be issued. Applicants with a priority date before this date may receive a visa.
- **Date for Filing**: The date when intending immigrants can submit their application paperwork, even if a visa is not yet available.

By monitoring both these dates across different **chargeability areas** (i.e., countries), we can spot patterns and shifts in visa backlogs over time.
